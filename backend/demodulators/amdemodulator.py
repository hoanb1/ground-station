    AM (Amplitude Modulation) demodulator that consumes IQ data and produces audio samples.

    1. Reads IQ samples from iq_queue (a subscriber queue from IQBroadcaster)
    2. Translates frequency based on VFO center frequency
    3. Decimates to appropriate bandwidth
    4. Demodulates AM using envelope detection (magnitude)
    5. Applies DC blocking filter

    Note: Multiple demodulators can run simultaneously, each with its own
