# This decoder receives raw IQ samples directly from the SDR process (via iq_queue)
# and demodulates BPSK signals with AX.25 or DOKA (CCSDS) framing.
#
# ARCHITECTURE NOTES (2025-11-19):
# ================================
# 1. SIGNAL-CENTERED FREQUENCY TRANSLATION (CRITICAL):
#    - MUST translate to the actual signal frequency from transmitter config, NOT VFO center
#    - offset_freq = signal_frequency - sdr_center_frequency
#    - This centers the signal at baseband (0 Hz) regardless of VFO drift
#    - Allows decoding off-center signals in recordings and multiple simultaneous signals
#
# 2. BATCHED PROCESSING WITH FRESH FLOWGRAPHS:
#    - Processes samples in configurable batches (default 10 seconds via batch_interval parameter)
#    - Creates a NEW gr.top_block for each batch to avoid GNU Radio 3.10 reconnection issues
#    - Hierarchical blocks (bpsk_demodulator, ax25_deframer) cannot be reconnected
#    - Aggressive cleanup in finally block prevents shared memory exhaustion
#    - Processing happens outside the lock: samples continue accumulating while batch processes
#    - UI receives "decoding" status for both accumulation and batch processing phases
#
# 3. SIGNAL PROCESSING CHAIN:
#    - Frequency translation (signal to baseband)
#    - Decimation to target sample rate (78125 Hz for 9600 baud)
#    - FLL (Frequency Lock Loop) - 250 Hz bandwidth for tracking residual offset
#    - AGC (Automatic Gain Control)
#    - Symbol sync with matched RRC filter
#    - Costas loop - 100 Hz bandwidth for carrier phase recovery
#    - Binary slicer, NRZI decode, G3RUH descrambler, HDLC deframing
#
# 4. KEY PARAMETERS:
#    - Batch interval: 10 seconds default (configurable, balance between latency and signal lock time)
#    - Batch overlap: 5 seconds (50% overlap to capture signals at batch boundaries)
#    - FLL bandwidth: 75 Hz (handles residual offset after doppler compensation)
#    - Costas bandwidth: 35 Hz (carrier phase tracking)
#    - Sample rate: Automatically calculated based on baudrate (10x oversampling)
#
# 5. FEATURES:
#    - Supports AX.25 (G3RUH) and DOKA (CCSDS) framing
#    - Handles VFO drift and off-center signals in IQ recordings
#    - Extracts and reports AX.25 callsigns to UI
#    - Automatic framing detection from satellite configuration
