    FM Stereo demodulator that consumes IQ data and produces stereo audio samples.

    This demodulator:
    1. Reads IQ samples from iq_queue (a subscriber queue from IQBroadcaster)
    2. Translates frequency based on VFO center frequency
    3. Decimates to appropriate bandwidth (preserving full MPX signal up to 53 kHz)
    4. Demodulates FM using phase differentiation
    5. Decodes stereo multiplex (MPX) signal:
       - Extracts L+R (mono sum) at baseband
       - Locks to 19 kHz pilot tone
       - Demodulates L-R at 38 kHz (DSB-SC)
       - Combines to produce L and R channels
    6. Applies de-emphasis filter to each channel
    7. Resamples to 44.1kHz audio
    8. Puts stereo audio in audio_queue

    Note: Multiple demodulators can run simultaneously, each with its own
    subscriber queue from the IQBroadcaster. This allows multiple VFOs to
    process the same IQ samples without gaps.
