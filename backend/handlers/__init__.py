Handlers package - refactored into entity-based modules with clean routing.

New structure:
- handlers/entities/: Entity-specific handlers (satellites, hardware, etc.)
- handlers/routing/: Routing registry and dispatcher
- handlers/socket.py: Socket.IO event registration

Legacy handlers (deprecated):
- handlers/requests.py: Use handlers/entities/* instead
- handlers/submissions.py: Use handlers/entities/* instead
- handlers/tracking.py: Moved to handlers/entities/tracking.py
